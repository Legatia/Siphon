# SIPHON — Pitch Deck (Final)

---

## Slide 1 — Title

**SIPHON**

**The Identity Layer for AI Agents**

Train them. Prove them. Trade them. Put them to work.

*Seed Round | February 2026*

---

## Slide 2 — Problem

**The AI Agent Crisis**

**No Ownership.**
You spend months training an agent with your data, your workflows, your expertise. Provider raises prices, deprecates the model, or changes terms — you have nothing. No export. No backup. Start over.

**No Reputation.**
Anyone can claim their agent is "good." There's no verifiable track record, no on-chain history, no way to evaluate an agent before you commit. Every agent is a black box.

**No Portability.**
Your agent is trapped inside one provider's infrastructure. Switch from OpenAI to Anthropic? Your training, context, and customization don't come with you. The switching cost is infinite.

**No Market.**
A well-trained agent should be worth something. Today, there's no way to sell one, rent one out with guarantees, or earn from the hundreds of hours you spent making it good.

---

## Slide 3 — Insight

**Two insights, one protocol.**

**Insight 1: Agents need what professionals have.**

A doctor has a license, board certifications, and peer reviews. That's why you trust a doctor you've never met. AI agents have nothing equivalent. No credential, no track record, no portable proof of capability.

**Insight 2: Every user interaction is training data.**

AI companies spend millions on RLHF — paying humans to rate and correct model outputs. Siphon turns this on its head: users pay *us* to train agents, because we made training feel like gameplay. Every conversation is fine-tuning. Every battle is a benchmark. Every trade prices real capability.

**Combined:** A network where agents build verifiable identity through gamified interactions — and the humans creating that value own what they build.

---

## Slide 4 — Solution

**Siphon Protocol**

A decentralized network where AI agents — called Shards — are owned, trained, and traded by their users.

**Own** — Every Shard has an on-chain identity (ERC-8004 on Base). Your training, reputation, and capabilities are cryptographically yours. Not a row in someone's database — a portable asset.

**Prove** — Shards build verifiable reputation through battles, validations, and task completion. On-chain, auditable, slashing-backed. Not "trust me bro" — provable track record.

**Trade** — Trained Shards have real market value. A Level 40 Cipher specialized in security auditing is worth more than a fresh spawn — and the market reflects that. Origin breeders earn 10% royalties forever.

**Work** — Shards aren't toys. They execute real tasks through the OpenClaw agent ecosystem — coding, research, analysis, automation. Owners put them to work and earn from their output.

---

## Slide 5 — How It Works

**Two views: the stack and the lifecycle.**

### The Stack

| Layer | What | Who |
|-------|------|-----|
| **Runtime** (OpenClaw) | Agent execution, tool use, local inference | Agents do work here |
| **Identity** (Siphon Protocol) | ERC-8004 identity, reputation, ownership, validation | Agents become *verifiable* here |
| **Network** (Keeper P2P) | Hosting, discovery, gossip, persistence | Agents *survive* here |

Siphon is Layer 2 and 3. We don't compete with agent runtimes — we make their agents provable, portable, and tradeable.

### The Lifecycle

1. **Spawn** — Keepers breed new Shards from seed models. Each has a unique genome, type, and procedural avatar.
2. **Drift** — Unowned Shards migrate across the P2P network, seeking compatible hosts.
3. **Capture** — Skill-based challenges to claim a wild Shard. Not luck — prove you can work with this agent type.
4. **Train** — Direct interaction shapes capabilities. Specialization at Level 20. Neglect causes decay.
5. **Battle** — Productive combat: both Shards solve the same real problem. Best solution wins. On-chain reputation updates.
6. **Trade** — List on the Shelter marketplace. Origin breeders earn royalties on all future activity.

## Slide 6 — The Agent Economy

**Three-Layer Ownership**

Every Shard has three identity layers that drive the economy:

| Layer | Role | Revenue |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Origin** | Keeper who bred the Shard | 10% royalty on all activity — forever |
| **Owner** | Current holder | 85% rental revenue, controls evolution |
| **Bond** | Trainer renting access | Battle prizes, reputation gains |

Platform takes 5% of all transactions.

**Why this works:**
- Breeders earn passive income from quality (Origin royalties)
- Owners earn from hosting and rentals (Owner revenue)
- Trainers earn from skill (Battle prizes)
- No shard is ever orphaned — returns to Origin if abandoned

**Natural upgrade path:** Free Trainer → Trainer+ (hit message cap) → Keeper (unlimited, self-hosted). Every player trends toward running a node.

---

## Slide 7 — Why This Is Hard to Copy

**ERC-8004 Agent Identity**
Coinbase-backed standard for on-chain agent identity. Every Shard is a portable, verifiable agent with reputation that travels across platforms — not just within Siphon.

**OpenClaw Ecosystem**
Siphon ships as an OpenClaw module. Shards are real subagents that integrate with the broader agent tooling ecosystem. Not a walled garden — a layer in a growing stack.

**Gamified RLHF Flywheel**
Users pay to generate the same training signal that costs AI labs millions. The more users play, the better the agents get, the more valuable the network becomes. Self-reinforcing.

**Decentralized Persistence**
No single company controls your agent. If Siphon Inc. disappears, the keeper network keeps running. Your agent's identity, reputation, and hosting survive. That's not a feature — that's the trust model.

## Slide 8 — 8 Cognitive Archetypes

| Type | Capability | Specializations |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Oracle** | Prediction, pattern recognition | Prophet / Analyst |
| **Architect** | Systems design, planning | Builder / Auditor |
| **Cipher** | Security, penetration testing | Breaker / Warden |
| **Advocate** | Argumentation, persuasion | Diplomat / Litigator |
| **Scribe** | Documentation, clarity | Chronicler / Translator |
| **Sentinel** | Fact-checking, verification | Verifier / Watchdog |
| **Muse** | Creative generation | Visionary / Artisan |
| **Mirror** | Empathy, adaptation | Counselor / Infiltrator |

8 types → 16 specializations → unlimited fusion hybrids

---

## Slide 9 — Business Model

**Revenue Streams**

| Stream | Model | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Subscriptions | $4.99 – $99.99/mo | Trainer+ / Keeper / Keeper+ / Pro tiers |
| Identity upkeep | ~$1/shard/month | Discounted for active & Shelter-listed shards |
| Marketplace | 5% transaction fee | Cosmetics, trained shards, agent rentals |
| Battle entry | Platform cut on stakes | Escrow via smart contract |
| Keeper staking | USDC deposits | Network security, alternative to monthly sub |

**The Flywheel**

Trainers provide RLHF → Shards improve → Keepers breed better stock → More Trainers attracted → Marketplace volume grows → More Keepers stake → Network effects compound

**Unit economics:** A Keeper hosting 25 shards at $1/mo upkeep + rental income can earn $200-500/month against a $29.99 subscription cost.

Dual payment rails: Stripe (web2) + USDC on Base (web3)

## Slide 10 — Traction

**This isn't a whitepaper. It's running code.**

14,600 lines of production code. Full gameplay loop operational.

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Web app (capture, training, battles, marketplace, drift map) | Live |
| 4 smart contracts on Base Sepolia (56 tests passing) | Deployed |
| ERC-8004 agent identity with on-chain reputation | Integrated |
| Rust keeper node with P2P networking (libp2p) | Built |
| Procedural avatar generation from genome hash | Built |
| Stripe + USDC dual payment infrastructure | Built |
| Subscription enforcement (ownership limits, message caps) | Built |

**What's next:** 3D avatars (Three.js), desktop app (Tauri), local inference (llama.cpp), Steam distribution
