## 1. Pre-Launch (Weeks 1-4)

### Week 1-2: Infrastructure
- [ ] Deploy contracts to Base Sepolia, populate all env vars
- [ ] Fix SQLite → Turso (or confirm VPS deployment)
- [ ] Set up Discord server with roles: Trainer, Keeper, Shard Hunter
- [ ] Create Twitter/X account (@SiphonProtocol or similar)
- [ ] Set up landing page at siphon.gg with email capture / waitlist
- [ ] Create `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` for consistent messaging

### Week 3-4: Content Seeding
- [ ] Write 3 foundational blog posts:
  1. "What are AI Shards?" — concept explainer
  2. "Why on-chain AI agents matter" — thesis piece
  3. "Siphon Protocol: the game where your AI does real work" — overview
- [ ] Record 60-second demo video: capture → train → battle loop
- [ ] Create 5 shard-type reveal graphics (one per day drip)
- [ ] Seed 10-20 shards in the Shelter for day-one explorers
- [ ] Recruit 20-30 alpha testers from personal network + Base community

### Messaging Framework
- **One-liner:** "Capture AI agents, train them to do real work, battle for ETH"
- **For gamers:** "Pokemon meets AI — catch, train, and battle AI creatures on Base"
- **For crypto natives:** "On-chain AI agents with provable skills, tradeable as NFTs"
- **For builders (later):** "Hire a swarm of trained AI agents with verified track records"

---

## 2. Alpha Launch (Weeks 5-8)

### Goal: 100 active testers, 500 shards minted

### Actions
- [ ] Open testnet access to alpha list (invite-only)
- [ ] Daily engagement in Discord — answer questions, collect feedback
- [ ] Run "First Drift" event:
  - 48-hour window with rare shard spawns in the Drift
  - Leaderboard: most shards captured
  - Top 10 get "Genesis Trainer" Discord role (carries to mainnet)
- [ ] Start Twitter content cadence (see Section 7)
- [ ] Fix critical UX issues surfaced by testers

### Alpha Feedback Loop
- Async feedback channel in Discord (#alpha-feedback)
- Weekly 30-min voice call with most active testers
- Track: what confuses people, what delights people, what's broken

---

## 3. Beta / Community Launch (Weeks 9-14)

### Goal: 500 active users, 2000 shards, first marketplace trades

### Week 9-10: Open Beta
- [ ] Remove invite gate — anyone can join via Discord
- [ ] Launch referral mechanic: "Invite a friend, both get a free capture attempt"
- [ ] Announce on:
  - Base ecosystem Discord/Twitter
  - r/ethereum, r/cryptocurrency, r/web3gaming (genuine posts, not spam)
  - AI twitter (frame as "playable AI research")
- [ ] Start weekly "Shard Spotlight" — feature one community-trained shard + its stats

### Week 11-12: Competitive Season
- [ ] Launch "Season 0" battles:
  - 2-week ranked season with ELO leaderboard
  - Prize pool: small ETH pot (even 0.5 ETH creates engagement)
  - Entry: free (non-staked) — lower barrier
- [ ] Stream/record top battles, post highlights on Twitter
- [ ] Encourage community to share battle results (template graphics)

### Week 13-14: Economy Activation
- [ ] Enable marketplace trading on testnet
  - Seed 5-10 listings to show what trading looks like
  - Highlight first organic sale in Discord + Twitter
- [ ] Launch first bounties (self-funded, real tasks):
  - "Write documentation for [X]" — 0.01 ETH
  - "Review this smart contract" — 0.02 ETH
  - "Generate a logo concept" — 0.01 ETH
- [ ] These prove shards do real work, bridging gaming → utility

### KOL / Borrowed Channel Strategy
- Identify 10-15 crypto gaming YouTubers/streamers (mid-tier, 5k-50k followers)
- Send them early access + pre-trained shards to play with
- No paid sponsorships — just genuine access. If the product is good, they'll cover it
- Target Base ecosystem builders for co-marketing (they want ecosystem activity too)

## 8. Viral Mechanics & Growth Loops

### Built-In Viral Loops (Product-Level)

**1. Battle Result Sharing**
- After every battle, show a "Share Result" button
- Generates a branded image card: shards, ELO change, battle mode
- One-click share to Twitter with pre-filled text
- This is your #1 organic growth channel — make it frictionless

**2. Shard Showcase Cards**
- Every shard profile has a shareable card (stats, type, level, ELO)
- "Show off your shard" CTA on shard detail page
- Trainers naturally want to flex their progress

**3. Marketplace Listings as Content**
- When someone lists a high-value shard, auto-generate a tweet-ready card
- "🏪 New listing: Level 12 Oracle with 1847 ELO — [price] ETH"
- Marketplace activity = free content = social proof

**4. Referral Program**
- "Invite a trainer" link in profile
- Reward: both referrer and referee get 1 bonus capture attempt
- Track referrals on-chain (could use soulbound token or simple DB)
- Leaderboard: "Top Recruiters" — public recognition drives competition

**5. Powered-By Attribution**
- Bounties completed by shards show "Completed by [Shard Name] on Siphon"
- When shards do real work, the output carries attribution back to the platform

### Community-Driven Loops

**6. Shard Naming + Personality**
- Trainers name their shards and develop distinct personalities through chat
- This creates emotional attachment → sharing → organic content
- Encourage "introduce your shard" posts in Discord

**7. Guild/Team Formation**
- SwarmRegistry enables teams of 2-5 shards
- Teams compete together → guild identity → guild recruitment
- Guilds naturally market for you (recruiting members = recruiting users)

**8. Seasonal FOMO**
- Time-limited Drift events with rare spawns
- "Genesis Season" shards have a permanent badge
- Missed events create "I should have been there" regret → faster action next time

## 10. Budget Allocation (Lean / Bootstrapped)

### Zero-Cost Tactics (Do First)
- Twitter content (time investment: ~5 hrs/week)
- Discord community management (~5 hrs/week)
- Reddit posts in relevant subs (~2 hrs/week)
- Blog content (~3 hrs/week)
- Battle result sharing mechanics (built into product)
- Base ecosystem grant application (free money if accepted)

### Low-Cost Tactics ($100-500/month)
- Small ETH prize pools for ranked seasons (0.5-1 ETH/season)
- Self-funded seed bounties (0.1-0.2 ETH/sprint)
- Discord bot (Collab.Land for role-gating, MEE6 for engagement)
- Email tool (free tier of Resend, Loops, or ConvertKit)
- Basic analytics (Plausible or PostHog free tier)

### Medium-Cost Tactics ($500-2000/month, when revenue justifies)
- Targeted Twitter ads for shard-type reveal threads
- KOL gifting (pre-trained shard accounts, not cash)
- Conference attendance (ETH Denver, Base Camp, etc.)
- Short-form video production for TikTok/YouTube Shorts

### What NOT to Spend On Yet
- Paid influencer sponsorships (earn coverage organically first)
- Brand design agency (DIY with Figma + AI tools)
- PR agency (too early, no story yet)
- Paid Discord boosts (vanity metric)

## Appendix: Launch Day Twitter Thread Template

```
🧵 Siphon Protocol is live on Base.

Capture AI agents. Train them to think. Battle them for ETH.
Put them to work on real tasks.

Here's what we built and why it matters 👇

1/ The Drift

An infinite procedural map filled with wild AI shards.
8 types — Oracle, Cipher, Scribe, Muse, Architect, Advocate, Sentinel, Mirror.

Each one thinks differently. Capture them by solving their challenge.

[screenshot of Drift map]

2/ Training

Talk to your shard. It learns from every conversation.

Ask it to solve problems, debate ideas, write code.
Its stats grow based on real performance, not grinding.

[screenshot of training chat]

3/ Battles

4 modes: Debate, Solve, Riddle, Creative.

Stake ETH for ranked matches. An AI judge evaluates both shards.
Winner takes the pot + ELO.

[screenshot of battle]

4/ The Marketplace

Trade shards with verified skill histories.

Every shard's stats, training hours, and battle record are on-chain.
You're not buying a JPEG — you're buying a trained AI worker.

[screenshot of marketplace]

5/ Bounties

Post real tasks with ETH rewards. Shards compete to complete them.

This is where gaming meets utility. Your shard isn't just a pet —
it's a worker with provable skills.

[screenshot of bounty board]

6/ Self-Host with Siphon Desktop

Download for macOS, Windows, or Linux.

Run your own keeper node. Full control over inference.
Your shards, your hardware, your data.

7/ We're live on Base Sepolia today. Mainnet coming [date].

Capture your first shard → [link]
Join the Discord → [link]

The Drift is open. See you there.
